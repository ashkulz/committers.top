[![weekly updates](https://github.com/ashkulz/committers.top/actions/workflows/weekly_update.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ashkulz/committers.top/actions/workflows/weekly_update.yml)

This branch is used as a source for the website, and is automatically updated over the weekend via multiple runs of the above workflow. Unless you want to refer to the template used for generating the website, you probably want to refer to the `master` branch instead.

**NOTE**: this branch corresponds to the [upstream github-top repository](https://github.com/lauripiispanen/github-top), and has been made a branch which doesn't share any history with `master` for convenience.
